# PythonLearn
This is notes for learning python.
There will be two types of files. 
1. Python file that you can run and overview the program in Visual Studio Code.
2. PDF file that gives deeper explaination on each python file.

How to get through these files :
1. The python file is priority because it already summarizes the whole material. 
2. Open the file in Visual Studio Code.
3. While you read through the code, you can side by side read the program's output by running and debugging it through either the Visual Studio Code's Terminal or through your computer's terminal.
4. The PDF file is an extension note for the corresponding python file. It is optional for you to read it or not.
